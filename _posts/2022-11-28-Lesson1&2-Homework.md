**Hack 1:**

**Hack 2:**
**In your own words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is**
- an operator is a procedure that gives an output.

**In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables?**
- the symbol <-- is used to assign a variable for college board (or in pseudo code).

**A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22?**
- If you print x, then the value will be changed to 22 because the computer takes the variable that has been assigned the latest. Since assigning x to 22 is the most recent line of code, more recent than x = 15, the program will output 22.

**Hack 3:**
**What is a list?**
- a list is a series of variables.

**What is an element**
- a smaller component in a larger system of code

**What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string?**
- it is easier to reference the elements in a list because that way they are all in one place and are in one line of code instead of multiple.

**What is an example of a string**
- 123-456-7890 (a phone number)

**Why are using lists better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code?**
- lists are better because that way you have all your variables in one place instead of multiple lines of code. It also manages complexity.

My own version of a list (both the long way and the simple way :)
