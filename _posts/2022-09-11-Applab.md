<p><strong>About the process:</strong>
My goal was to create an app like game and at first it was frustrating. I created this game, kind of like a ping pong game, where you have a ball that goes in all directions, and you have a paddle where it can bounce off of. And there is a coin that you have to try to get, and when you get it, you get a point and the ball moves a little faster and the game continues. I got all of the code to work and the images, but no matter what I did, the paddle and the ball would not move like it was supposed to. Eventually I just left it because there was nothing wrong with my code, but there was nothing I could do to change it. Instead I settled on a quiz about myself and that was pretty easy. Overall I thought being creative was fun and I liked doing this. Although, I hated  the frustration of not getting my game to work.</p>
