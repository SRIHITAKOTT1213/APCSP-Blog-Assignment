<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our idea is to make a page where you can find a bunch of games that each one of us has created. We choose what games we want to create and we will put it on a blog for all to see and try!</li>
</ul>

<li>Now we started to brainstorm what games we could add to our blog. Games that weren't too complicated but also fit all the Collegeboard criteria. </li>
<li>Games such as Snake, Tetris, Pong, etc. </li>
<li>We decided that we would each pick a game to do and that would add up to multiple games.</li>
</ul>
