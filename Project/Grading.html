<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For the most part, me and college board seem to agree on what the scoring for most of the criteria should be. For me, I didn't give the points for managing complexity because the person who submitted this video did not submit a code segment to show how it was managing complexity, which was part of the criteria, so I didn't give them points. College board didn't give them points because they said that it didn't meet any of the criteria so the it did not recive the point. I gave a point for the Purpose and function because I thought that it functioned well with an input and output and function and that the person answered and described the functions as part of the criteria. But college board didn't give that person the point because they did not describe the purpose of the program and instead the function, which did not meet college board criteria. In my opinion I think that is a little harsh because they met 5/6 of the criteria and still got a 0 but I understand why college board didn't give them the point.</li>

<li>This one was a little confusing because I gave less points to this person because there were a few places where it asked for pieces of code and I didn't see any, so I thought they didn't meet some of the criteria and didn't give them the point, even though their explanations were really good. But maybe they reused pieces of code or I just didn't see it because College Board gave them full points. I did like how they explained their code and they definitely met that part of the criteria. I thought the responses were hard to read though, because I don't know what the labels mean.</li>

<li>For the first row, I didn't give them the point because I felt like they didn't describe the function (the how it works) and more of the purpose (of what it does). College Board thought they met three of the siz criteria needed for this row. I didn't give them points for the second row either because for the first part of the criteria, they were supposed to give a list, which they did, and then that same list being part of some bigger piece of code, but they gave the same list with different variables (one list of images and another list of those same image but in names), so they did not show the bigger part of the code. College Board also thought that they didn't meet this same criteria. For both the third row and the fourth I gave them the point because I thought they were reusing their code from the previous question like the project before this one that I graded, but it looks like College Board thought the same thing I did and didn't see the lines of code that was needed for both of these areas and therefore didn't meet the criteria. I didn't give the point for the 5th row because they only explained what it does and didn't give steps so I definitely wouldn't even know how to begin to start recreating it even though the other projects gave a few steps that I would be able to build off of so they didn't earn the point in this row. And lastly, I gave them the point for testing because they met all the criteria for that. I think that I went more easy on them then College Board, but I see why they got such a low score. even though it was such an amazing looking project, they didn't know what they were talking about or what the criterias were.</li>

<li>College Board thought that this project got full credit and I see why, because they explained everything in great detail. The only reason I took points off is because for Row 2, I didn't see that same code being shown in a bigger piece of code but two seperate code segments and I thought that was bad, but it is apparently ok. And the other place I took off points was because I didn't see where they included the line segment that was required but maybe they reused a piece of code that they used for a previous question and missed it.</li>

<li>For this one, my scoring was way off. I thought that they did well on everything but the 5th row because I couldn't see the code that was required for that and it looks like College Board agreed. College Board liked the first row and thought that it met all of the criteria. For the 2nd row, there were two code segments, but only one of them was a list and they didn't like that. they also didn't like the fact that the description following the lines of code were inaccurate. For the the 3rd row, it included the code segment but did not explain why the code couldn't be written another way then the one provided or why it would be inefficient, which was part of the criteria so they got no points for that part. For the 4th row, it did not include a parameter and inaccurately described the function of it so it met none of the criteria for that section and recieved no points for that. For the 5th row, doesn't include iteration, and the response only partially explains the algorithm and not explain it fully. And lastly, they did not recieve any points for the 6th row because they did correctly answer the question by describing the two parameters called, the two conditions, and the two results. That is why College Board gave them such a low score and I should have paid more attention to those details and probably would have given them a lower score if I looked at it again. But I didn't think they did THAT bad, which means that College Board is really, really stict on its criteria.</li>

<li>So for once, me and college board got the same score for this person, but we took points off in different areas. I took it of in the 5th row because I didn't see the code that was required for the question. I am seeing a common theme here. Maybe the students use the same lines of code for multiple questions. College Board took points off on row 6 because they didn't meet any of the criteria and that means that they didn't properly answer the question that was being asked.</li>

<li>Ok, so I was close to the grading on this one. I gave full points for the the first row because it seemed that the program functioned fine. I gave full points for the second row as well but college board didn't because the person didn't meet the criteria of showing the list being used in the second line of code, which I actually thought about and noticed that same thing, but I thought that it was ok since the person showed values that were contained in the list being used but not the actual list in the second code segment so it makes sense that the row didn't get full points from college board. I didn't give any points for the third row because it didn't explain in great detail so that I could replicate it, which I can't, and they didn't answer the second half of the question which is why it wouldn't work, or why it would be inefficient, if the code were written in a different way other than the one provided, so I didn't give them that point, and neither did college board. For the fourth row, I gave them the point because even though I didn't see a piece of code I assumed that they reused the same piece of code from the previous questsions but the problem was that they didn't answer the question properly, and I understand that because I couldn't tell whether their answer was for this particular question or answering in a different row altogether. I didn't give them the fifth row point because once again I couldn't tell whether I was reading the right answer choices for this question but it looked like it was answering the question, but college board thought that they explained it well, and I think that I just need to read carefully and figure out if it was actually answering the question. And lastly for the sixth row, both me and College Board gave them the points because they met all the criteria, answering what happens at the first and second calls, the conditions, and the results.</li>

<li>Me and college board were on the same page for most of the rows and agreed that this person did a really good job. College gave them a 6 but I gave them a 5, because for the second row, one of the criteria was that the second piece of code was to show the list being used in the program, but I didn't see the name of the list in that program but another list, which was not shown, so I thought that they failed to meet that part of the criteria, but they didn't.</li>

<li>For the second row, College Board took points off because in the second code segment, it didn't provide the list in the the program when that was a requirement, so it makes sense. We both didn't give points for the third row because their response for one of the criteria did not adress the fact of why the program would be inefficient without the list that they used, so no points for that. For the sixth row, college board didn't give them the point because they described two conditions of the program instead of two arguments. I did not see that part thoroughly enough so I gave them the point.</li>
