In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? . the symbol &lt;– is used to assign a variable for college board (or in pseudo code). | . A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? . If you print x, then the value will be changed to 22 because the computer takes the variable that has been assigned the latest. Since assigning x to 22 is the most recent line of code, more recent than x = 15, the program will output 22. | . Hack 3: What is a list? . a list is a series of variables. | . What is an element . a smaller component in a larger system of code | . What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string? . it is easier to reference the elements in a list because that way they are all in one place and are in one line of code instead of multiple. | . What is an example of a string . 123-456-7890 (a phone number) | . List: . Index: . Hack 4: . Hack 5: Python Quiz . Before: . Simplified version: . Why are using lists better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code? . lists are better because that way you have all your variables in one place instead of multiple lines of code.

            "content": "Question 1: I thought that the answer was C because the function is being repeated three times, but I realize that C says that is being repeated 5 times, which is not what is happening. If you were to write out the function, it would be: 2 x 5 x 5 x 5, which is the same thing as 2(5)^3, hence why we limit it to C and D. But the correct answer is D because we multiply the result by 5 and that happens three times (repeats 3 times), that is why the Answer is D . . Question 4: I thought all three was correct because Alejandra would need their contacts in order to set up the meal. But as it turns out, onlly the user needs to give the contact, which when I see it, the question does say that. So only one and two are correct because they need the location of Alejandra to see what places are nearby and they need to know what are the dietary restrictions of each person in the group. . . Question 6: The answer is B because It will continue to repeat until the procedure has reached the max, whatever number that may be. The count starts at one, and since it hasn&#39;t reached the max yet, it will add two to it, making it the next odd integer and it will repeat through that cycle until it reaches the max, making it less than or equal to the max, printing only positive odd integers. When I first did this, I didn&#39;t understand what the first part of the code was doing. Now I do. . . Question 8: Since the numlist k and the numlist j were assigned to each other, they have been swapped, their values have been swapped. But what I couldn&#39;t understand is why it had to be between 1 and the length of the list. I think it is because one is the starting of the list in this case, and not 0, and obviously the end had to be the length of the list, so in a way it makes sense that j and k have to be in between those two numbers. . . Question 11: The j + 1 make it so that the program compares with all of the values that follow right after, not just one value that follows after, that is why C is wrong and why D must be wrong to because it doesn&#39;t only compare values that preceed it. B makes the most sense because it means that the program will compare the values in order, which makes more sense than the program comparing all the values randommly. . . Question 13: What the question was asking, and I didn&#39;t get this, was which one of the lists provided in the answer choices would give a different result than expected of the program. It makes sense that the answer is C because if you plug in A in the procedure, then it will return false for all the values, which is what we want to happen because it contains no positive values, the same goes for B, so we can cross them out. Then comes D, where all of the values will return true because they are positve, which is true because the entire list has positive values, so the program works for that list, so we can eliminate D. But when we get to C, the program says false for the first to numbers, but then true for 1, which shouldn&#39;t be true because in order for it to be true, the entire list would have to be full of positive integers, which is not the case. . . Question 18: C has to be the correct answer because the internet is a network, which C is the only option that mentions that. But also, the World Wide Web has to be several linked pages in programs and not just one because you can get all sorts of information from them and they are not apart of the same page, so C has to be the right answer. D isn&#39;t because I am pretty sure that the internet uses protocols and is not a protocol itself. . . Question 23: Analog data can be measured by samples, and a sequence of bits, which is why D makes the most sense. I didn&#39;t know that when I thought of the answer to this question, but now I do. . . Question 25: This was a simple mistake. since age was a word, I thought that it was a string, but it turns out that age is usually represented as a number. Maybe because we usually asign it to a number so that is probably why. . . Question 27: Student name is a string, because it is a word, but the absent part being a boolean confused me a litte. But it makes sense now because a boolean value is a value that either true of false. So, you can either be absent or not and that is why it is a boolean value. . . Question 35: The part with if else statement I got because it is pretty straightforward. But the other answer, A and B, I couldn&#39;t decide where to put the maxPS &lt;--50, on the top of the bottom. It is on the top, I think, because if that requirent is not met, then it will go down to the next line of code instead of the other way around. . . Question 36: It was the same problem I had with the previous question. I knew either C or D was the correct answer but I didn&#39;t know whether the APPEND function went first or not. Now I know that in this case it does. . . Question 45: I think it is B because since the value has to be greater than 0 for both, you can&#39;t start at 0. So then you got the next number, which is 1, and then the line of code starts to execute and that is why you get those numbers. . . What I did when I got stuck: . The first thing I did when I got stuck on these questions is that I looked at the question closely and see if there were any hints as to what the topic the question was directing to. Luckily, the question would say something like binary numbers or data abstraction, so that gave me a clue as to what topic I needed to look at. Then I would find that topic on college board (one of the topics straight up said Binary Numbers, or something like that) and then I would look at the videos on that topic to get a better idea of what that topic was, because I had no idea what that topic was. And then after that I would take that information and answer the question, which was a lot easier after seeing the college board videos. There were also questions that were more vocab based. One question asked something about Boolean values, and I didn&#39;t know what boolean meant, so then I would search it up on the internet to know what boolean meant and then approach the question. After submitting the test, the college board explanations for the questions that I didn&#39;t understand also helped me to better understand why one answer was better than the other, and If it didn&#39;t make sense, then I would search up and see if there was a response on the internet that would make more sense to me. This what I did to better help me understand these questions. | .",

A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function | One person is “the driver” where they type out the code. And the other person is “the navigator” who looks over the driver and monitors what they are doing | Sharing ideas with each other is important because then you get more idea | Leaving comments in code is helpful so you or your partner know where you left off or if there is something that needs fixing. | Ask people to test drive your program so that way you get more feedback. | . Unit 1.2 Notes: . There are physical devices such as watches and phones and pacemakers. There are applications such as media and games. And there are systems that are not stored on our local server. | Computers programs accept input in different forms | Computers can take in tactile, audio, visual and text “Events” are triggered by some action which send input to the program | Input effects the output | A statement is a single command and a group of statements are called code segments. | And code segments are different for different programming languages. | Program is often referred to as software | . Unit 1.3 Notes: . All programming starts with an idea and they are developed with a specific program in mind | There are several steps in the process. Both on what you should do and what you should not do | Once we have an idea, then we need to think on how we can turn this idea into reality. | There are time constraints too, so you have to understand how much time you have and plan accordingly. | Then brainstorm on what you have already figured out and it is another form of planning. | After brainstorming they will organize their ideas into modules and divide up the work so it is not too much work. | There is always testing after every step of the programming so they can monitor if the program is working correctly and if the user is able to interact with the program as intended. They also use user feedback to better their program. | . Unit 1.4 Notes: . Errors and programming go hand-in-hand and it is impossible to write a program without encountering at least one error. | A logic error is a mistake that the programmer makes when typing the line of code. | Syntax error is when a programmer makes a typo and the language doesn’t recognize it and the program fails to run. | A run-time error is when the program fails in the midst of running. This is commonly referred to as a bug | Overflow error results when the program is asked to calculate a problem that is outside the range of values | Use a number of test cases to make sure that your program works | Borderline cases should also be tested. | . Unit 4.1 Notes: . Computers are capable of sending and receiving data | A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending and receiving data. | Packet Switching: the message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. | The packets are then reassembled by the recipient&#39;s device. | Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. | Protocols establish a common standard for how to send messages between devices on the internet | A packet contains data that is being transmitted as well as metadata containing information used for routing information. | The internet was designed to be scalable - able to change in size in order to meet new demands | .",

About the process: My goal was to create an app like game and at first it was frustrating. I created this game, kind of like a ping pong game, where you have a ball that goes in all directions, and you have a paddle where it can bounce off of. And there is a coin that you have to try to get, and when you get it, you get a point and the ball moves a little faster and the game continues. I got all of the code to work and the images, but no matter what I did, the paddle and the ball would not move like it was supposed to. Eventually I just left it because there was nothing wrong with my code, but there was nothing I could do to change it. Instead I settled on a quiz about myself and that was pretty easy. Overall I thought being creative was fun and I liked doing this. Although, I hated the frustration of not getting my game to work. .

Notes: How did you realize you wanted to do computers? . A few of the people said that they took it because they liked problem solving, others said thhey liked it because they were good at it, and one more said she didn&#39;t like it but it was useful for many things and doing a few internships solidified her choice. | . What is the biggest challenge you&#39;ve encountered in computers? . Starting sucks | There is a solution to everything and you just have to have enough patience | It is hard finding motivation to continue | Fighting the temptation to copy work just to get over it | always getting a syntax error is super frustrating and hard | . Are there any PBL scenarios in college computer science classes? . There are a few projects, one that you do in Freshman year and another you do in Senior year. | Both in class and out of class, a lot of people study in groups and work with other people to learn better because the Professor has too many students and won&#39;t always be able to answer your questions. | Finding a good group is important because you rely on them to learn | . Have you applied CS in your major? . Coding will be everywhere and it can be used for pretty much anything | It can be used for all of your assignments and is really useful | What we are now learning is applicable to pretty much everything | . For existing college students, have you had a job for school or with a professor? . They recommend resumes | Doing internships and jobs | Some professors have clubs and others have research labs, and you can ask if there is a spot available and join | There are path finding algorithms everywhere | . KEY TAKEAWAYS: Computer Science can be used for anything and coding is used for everything so it is an important skill to learn. There are also many jobs that use the things/tools that we are learning in class so the more we learn, the more we can put it to use. And yes, computers can be frustrating, but they are worth the hardwork and patience and when you get through it, the output is most of the time rewarding. So this class is important and it is important to always try our best and learn as much as possible. .",
