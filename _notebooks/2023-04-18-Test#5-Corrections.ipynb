    "I didn't do as well as I thought I did but I did do better then my normal score so I think I am definetly improving. There are a few questions that I had genuine doubts on because I had no idea what the questions were asking, but the ones that I got wrong, I can see how I got those questions wrong and I am sure that once I review all of the college board videos and then once I have all of the information then it shouldn't be too bad. The questions I get wrong the most are the questions about certain terminology that I don't know like phising, I know that, but there was another question about a term I didn't know and I tried searching it up but that didn't do me any good so I had to guess. Another reason I might have gotten a lot wrong is because I was sort of rushing through some of it and checking the time frequently because I wasn't proffesionally keeping track of the time when doing this practice test and I got restless after a while of doing the practice questions so that is something I have to work on.
