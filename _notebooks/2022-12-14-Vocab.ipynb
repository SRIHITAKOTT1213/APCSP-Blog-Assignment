    " ### Collatz  \n",
    "- The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Hailstone numbers\n",
    "- The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples: Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Iteration\n",
    "- The action or a process of iterating or repeating: such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Undecidable problems \n",
    "- An undecidable problem is one that should give a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Unsolvable problems\n",
    "- An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration: \n",
    "- a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration Statements: \n",
    "- change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeat Until:\n",
    "- if the condition evaluates to true initially, the loop body is not executed at all, due to the condition being checked before the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traversing Lists:\n",
    "- where all elements in the list are accessed, or a partial traversal, where only a portion of elements are accessed (can be a complete traversal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A procedure:\n",
    "- is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values.\n",
    "-  May be called \"method\" or \"function\" in different programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "- are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values.\n",
    "- Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modularity \n",
    "- the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction \n",
    "- the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duplication \n",
    "- having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic\n",
    "- the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure \n",
    "- a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure Name\n",
    "- the name that is given to a function/procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments\n",
    "- a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection:\n",
    "- A selection is a decision or a question. At some point in the program, the computer may need to ask a question because it has reached a point where there are one or more options available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "- It is like a recipe. It is lines of codes that a computer follows to solve a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Condition:\n",
    "- They are basically a decision making statement in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators:\n",
    "### AND: \n",
    "- returns true if both of the values being compared are true and returns false if either of the values are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OR:\n",
    "- Returns true if either of the conditions are true. And returns false if both of the conditions are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOT:\n",
    "- Returns true if the following condition is false. Returns false if it is true.\n",
    "\n"
