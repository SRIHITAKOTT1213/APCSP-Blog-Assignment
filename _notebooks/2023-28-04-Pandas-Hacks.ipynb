    "Predictive analysis is the use of **statistical**, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future events or behaviors. It involves identifying **patterns** and trends in data, and then using that information to forecast what is likely to happen in the future.\n",

    "Predictive analysis is used in a wide range of applications, from forecasting sales and demand, to predicting customer behavior, to detecting fraudulent transactions. It involves collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including historical data, customer data, financial data, and social media data, among others.\n",

    "1. Defining the problem and identifying the relevant data sources\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most basic operations that can be performed on arrays is **arithmetic operations**. With numpy, it is very easy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays. You can **add**, **subtract**, **multiply** and **divide** arrays, just like you would with regular numbers. When performing these operations, numpy applies the operation element-wise, meaning that it performs the operation on each element in the array separately. This makes it easy to perform operations on large amounts of data quickly and efficiently."

    "### 4. Data analysis using numpy\n",
    "Numpy provides a convenient and powerful way to perform data analysis tasks on **large datasets**. One of the most common tasks in data analysis is finding the **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation** of a dataset. Numpy provides functions to perform these operations quickly and easily. The mean function calculates the average value of the data, while the median function calculates the middle value in the data. The standard deviation function calculates how spread out the data is from the mean. Additionally, numpy provides functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the data. These functions are very useful for gaining insight into the properties of large datasets and can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks."
