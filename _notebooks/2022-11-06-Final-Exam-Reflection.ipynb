    "**Question 1:** I thought that the answer was C because the function is being repeated three times, but I realize that C says that is being repeated 5 times, which is not what is happening. If you were to write out the function, it would be: 2 x 5 x 5 x 5, which is the same thing as 2(5)^3, hence why we limit it to C and D. But the correct answer is D because we multiply the result by 5 and that happens three times (repeats 3 times), that is why the **Answer is D**"

So only one and two are correct because they need the location of Alejandra to see what places are nearby and they need to know what are the dietary restrictions of each person in the group."

The count starts at one, and since it hasn't reached the max yet, it will add two to it, making it the next odd integer and it will repeat through that cycle until it reaches the max, making it less than or equal to the max, printing only positive odd integers. When I first did this, I didn't understand what the first part of the code was doing. Now I do."

But what I couldn't understand is why it had to be between 1 and the length of the list. I think it is because one is the starting of the list in this case, and not 0, and obviously the end had to be the length of the list, so in a way it makes sense that j and k have to be in between those two numbers."

    "**Question 13:** What the question was asking, and I didn't get this, was which one of the lists provided in the answer choices would give a different result than expected of the program. It makes sense that the answer is C because if you plug in A in the procedure, then it will return false for all the values, which is what we want to happen because it contains no positive values, the same goes for B, so we can cross them out. Then comes D, where all of the values will return true because they are positve, which is true because the entire list has positive values, so the program works for that list, so we can eliminate D. But when we get to C, the program says false for the first to numbers, but then true for 1, which shouldn't be true because in order for it to be true, the entire list would have to be full of positive integers, which is not the case."

But also, the World Wide Web has to be several linked pages in programs and not just one because you can get all sorts of information from them and they are not apart of the same page, so C has to be the right answer. D isn't because I am pretty sure that the internet uses protocols and is not a protocol itself."

    "**What I did when I got stuck:**\n",
    "- The first thing I did when I got stuck on these questions is that I looked at the question closely and see if there were any hints as to what the topic the question was directing to. Luckily, the question would say something like binary numbers or data abstraction, so that gave me a clue as to what topic I needed to look at. Then I would find that topic on college board (one of the topics straight up said Binary Numbers, or something like that) and then I would look at the videos on that topic to get a better idea of what that topic was, because I had no idea what that topic was. And then after that I would take that information and answer the question, which was a lot easier after seeing the college board videos. There were also questions that were more vocab based. One question asked something about Boolean values, and I didn't know what boolean meant, so then I would search it up on the internet to know what boolean meant and then approach the question. After submitting the test, the college board explanations for the questions that I didn't understand also helped me to better understand why one answer was better than the other, and If it didn't make sense, then I would search up and see if there was a response on the internet that would make more sense to me. This what I did to better help me understand these questions."
