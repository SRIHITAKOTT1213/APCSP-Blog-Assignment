    "**N@tM:** Night of the museum was the same as last trimester, except this time I got to see other projects other than just the ones in the room. I thought this night of the museum was better because we had a lot of people come and see our project and it was pretty relaxed. Other than the computer science projects I saw the CSA projects, ceramics, digital media, and photography. Those were all really great projects to see."
