    "- Chat GPT was sponsored by microsoft and put 1 million dollars in it\n",

    "\n",
    "- Ex. face recognition only worked on light skinned people because they only tested on light skinned people, so when they put it out into the world it didn’t work on darker skinned people. That is an example of bias.\n",

    "- **Pros**: **1)** websites like google allow people to get information that can help them with school homework, getting internships, fixing a car, and any other information that you need in order to get the task at hand done. **2)** It is faster for designs and creation and in a way you can back up data so that way it is in a safe spot and you won't lose the data. **3)** Websites have different perspectives so you can get even more information on a topic than you would if it were just one perspective.\n",
    "**Cons:** **1)** Sometimes the information on the websites might not be true or might be biased, so the information might not be accurate. **2)** If you forget to save your data, because it is as much as you as it is a computer, then there is a chance that everything that you had could be lost and might not be able to be recovered. **3)** Sometimes those different perspectives lead to contraversy and it might be hard to come to a conclusion to what the information from the sources are trying to say. It may be more anticlamatic.\n",

    "- I personally have nothing impacting my studies from school and I do believe that dopamine issues are real under the right circumstance. My parents always tell me not to watch too much of the screen because they say that it ruins your eyes and disrupts your sleep, and I believe that, which makes that a negative. I don't need computers or devices to be happy but that doesn't mean that it doesn't contribute to my happiness. For me, watching movies is a nice pass time, but I get happiness from spending time with my friends (Like I did this weekend)."

    "- I think the best way someone can empower themself in the digital world is to learn as much as they can whenever they can. If you don't have a phone, for example, but your parents do, you can always ask to borrow it or that they can help out with texting someone or something, and learn how to use it. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**\n",
    "- I think it depends on the type of people you are with. Right now I think that we are in a digital age and that paper is only used in some, and not all, classes and that most are embracing the fact of using the devices. For me, I use my computer as much as a use paper and I think that in the future, more devices will be used and less of paper because it is both enviornmentally friendly and more convenient."

    "- Pros to having internet blockers means that people won't be able to view inappropriate content, at least during the school day, and not having an admin password for lab machines means that anyone can use it if they really need to. Cons of having internet blockers is that half the stuff we do is on the computer and data plan can only last so long, so we would need internet and the lack of internet would be a problem. and a con for not having an admin password to lab machines means that people with bad intentions can damage it so that no one else can use it, which isn't great.\n",
