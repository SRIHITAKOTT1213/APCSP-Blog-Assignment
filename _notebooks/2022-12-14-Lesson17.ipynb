    "The next two codes are for algorithm efficiency. The first code is inefficient because the programer has to right the same code over and over again, only with using different numbers, which gets messy and annoying. The second code, however, puts all the values in a list and takes the square root all at once. So that way, all you have to do is add numbers, not functions, which is way more convenient."
