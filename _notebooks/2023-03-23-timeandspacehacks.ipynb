    "    - Time complexity I think is compressing the data so that the program runs faster. If the program is too slow, then it might not execute properly. For me, when I tried running the largest image file in the line of code, 40000, it not only took a really long time to run, but once it was done, the image didn't show up. I ran it another time and it crashed my vscode and I had to restart my computer to get it working normally again.\n",

    "- **Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I think it's important because it can effect how fast or how well the program runs. If there is not enough space then the program might stop short because there is not enough space for the algorithm to run completely. As with the previous question, if it takes a very long time, then the program might fail as well.\n",
