    "> In this program, the **binary operators** & (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), and ~ (NOT) are used to perform the binary operations on the input numbers. The results are stored in separate variables as **decimal numbers**. Then, the **bin ()** function is used to convert each decimal result to binary, and the binary strings are stored in separate variables. Finally, the program returns a tuple of tuples, with each inner tuple containing both the decimal and binary result for each operation. The outer tuple is **unpacked** into separate variables for printing, and the results are displayed as both decimal and binary."
