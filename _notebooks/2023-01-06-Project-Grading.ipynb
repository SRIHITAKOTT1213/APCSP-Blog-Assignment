    "- For the most part, me and college board seem to agree on what the scoring for most of the criteria should be. For me, I didn't give the points for managing complexity because the person who submitted this video did not submit a code segment to show how it was managing complexity, which was part of the criteria, so I didn't give them points. College board didn't give them points because they said that it didn't meet any of the criteria so the it did not recive the point. I gave a point for the Purpose and function because I thought that it functioned well with an input and output and function and that the person answered and described the functions as part of the criteria. But college board didn't give that person the point because they did not describe the purpose of the program and instead the function, which did not meet college board criteria. In my opinion I think that is a little harsh because they met 5/6 of the criteria and still got a 0 but I understand why college board didn't give them the point."
