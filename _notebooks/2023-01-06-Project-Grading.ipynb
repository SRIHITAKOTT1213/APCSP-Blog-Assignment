    "- For the most part, me and college board seem to agree on what the scoring for most of the criteria should be. For me, I didn't give the points for managing complexity because the person who submitted this video did not submit a code segment to show how it was managing complexity, which was part of the criteria, so I didn't give them points. College board didn't give them points because they said that it didn't meet any of the criteria so the it did not recive the point. I gave a point for the Purpose and function because I thought that it functioned well with an input and output and function and that the person answered and described the functions as part of the criteria. But college board didn't give that person the point because they did not describe the purpose of the program and instead the function, which did not meet college board criteria. In my opinion I think that is a little harsh because they met 5/6 of the criteria and still got a 0 but I understand why college board didn't give them the point."

    "- For the first row, I didn't give them the point because I felt like they didn't describe the function (the how it works) and more of the purpose (of what it does). College Board thought they met three of the siz criteria needed for this row. I didn't give them points for the second row either because for the first part of the criteria, they were supposed to give a list, which they did, and then that same list being part of some bigger piece of code, but they gave the same list with different variables (one list of images and another list of those same image but in names), so they did not show the bigger part of the code. College Board also thought that they didn't meet this same criteria. For both the third row and the fourth I gave them the point because I thought they were reusing their code from the previous question like the project before this one that I graded, but it looks like College Board thought the same thing I did and didn't see the lines of code that was needed for both of these areas and therefore didn't meet the criteria. I didn't give the point for the 5th row because they only explained what it does and didn't give steps so I definitely wouldn't even know how to begin to start recreating it even though the other projects gave a few steps that I would be able to build off of so they didn't earn the point in this row. And lastly, I gave them the point for testing because they met all the criteria for that. I think that I went more easy on them then College Board, but I see why they got such a low score. even though it was such an amazing looking project, they didn't know what they were talking about or what the criterias were."

    "- For this one, my scoring was way off. I thought that they did well on everything but the 5th row because I couldn't see the code that was required for that and it looks like College Board agreed. College Board liked the first row and thought that it met all of the criteria. For the 2nd row, there were two code segments, but only one of them was a list and they didn't like that. they also didn't like the fact that the description following the lines of code were inaccurate. For the the 3rd row, it included the code segment but did not explain why the code couldn't be written another way then the one provided or why it would be inefficient, which was part of the criteria so they got no points for that part. For the 4th row, it did not include a parameter and inaccurately described the function of it so it met none of the criteria for that section and recieved no points for that. For the 5th row, doesn't include iteration, and the response only partially explains the algorithm and not explain it fully. And lastly, they did not recieve any points for the 6th row because they did correctly answer the question by describing the two parameters called, the two conditions, and the two results. That is why College Board gave them such a low score and I should have paid more attention to those details and probably would have given them a lower score if I looked at it again. But I didn't think they did THAT bad, which means that College Board is really, really stict on its criteria."
