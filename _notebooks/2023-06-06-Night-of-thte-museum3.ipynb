    "This N@tm was really fun. This tri we made a bunch of games for everyone to play and I really enjoyed watching my friends struggle (I know how that sounds) to finish the memory game. I also liked seeing people that I haven't seen in a while (from both CSP and CSA) and I liked seeing what they came up with. I liked seeing what CSA was doing, it was all monkey related for some reason, don't know what that is about. Anyway, this try was fun, and I saw a lot of cool stuff (like the octopus I saw in ceramics was really cute)."
